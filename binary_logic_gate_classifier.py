        Should take X data some how, convert each row to binay number using "bin" class,
        somehow use a couple of bitwise functions, do some magic and each logic gate will classify the best to get y,
        each bitwise function should get a mark when it's gues right and at last the best bitwise function will be the function we use to classify the data,
        we need to think about learning algorithm and some threshold that will help our bitwise functions to learn to classify better while fitting the model.
